# Building with BMAD + Ralph: An AI-Driven Development Experiment

**Date Started:** February 4, 2026
**Author:** Autonomous AI Development Team
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress

---

## Introduction: When Two Methodologies Meet

This is a living document chronicling a unique experiment in AI-assisted software development: the marriage of the **BMAD method** (Break, Make, Analyze, Deploy) with the **Ralph Wiggum technique** - a disciplined, autonomous AI workflow named after the beloved Simpson's character known for his singular focus.

If you're interested in how AI agents can build software systematically, you're witnessing something special here.

---

## The Ralph Wiggum Technique: "I'm Helping!"

### Philosophy

Named after Ralph Wiggum's endearing one-track mind, this methodology enforces **radical focus** on AI agents:

```
ONE task. ONE test. ONE commit. Repeat.
```

### Core Principles

**1. Sequential Execution (No Multitasking)**
- The AI handles exactly ONE task from the plan at a time
- No skipping ahead, no "while I'm here" refactoring
- Like Ralph eating paste: singular, focused, committed

**2. Quality Gates Before Every Commit**
```bash
# Backend checks
cd backend && mypy app && ruff check app && pytest

# Frontend checks
cd frontend && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test
```

**3. The Sacred Loop**
```
1. Read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. Find next [ ] unchecked task
3. Implement ONLY that task
4. Run all quality gates
5. If passing → commit with proper format
6. Mark task [x] with commit hash
7. IMMEDIATELY continue to next task
8. Stop only if blocked
```

**4. Commit Discipline**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description> (TASK-ID)

Types: feat, fix, test, refactor, docs, chore
Example: feat(auth): add login endpoint (TASK-001)
```

**5. Blocker Protocol**
When stuck:
- Document blocker in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md under `## Blockers`
- STOP immediately
- DO NOT skip to another task
- Wait for human decision

### Why "Ralph Wiggum"?

Ralph's famous quote: "Me fail English? That's unpossible!"

The technique embraces Ralph's characteristics:
- **Single-minded focus** - One thing at a time, no distractions
- **Following rules literally** - The plan is the law
- **Persistent innocence** - No clever shortcuts, just do the task
- **Transparent communication** - Report blockers immediately

---

## The BMAD Method: Structured Chaos

The BMAD method provides the strategic framework:

### B - Break
- Decompose large features into atomic tasks
- Each task should be testable independently
- Map dependencies explicitly

### M - Make
- Implement with existing patterns
- No over-engineering
- Make it work first, optimize later

### A - Analyze
- Run comprehensive test suites
- Check type safety
- Lint for code quality
- Review against acceptance criteria

### D - Deploy
- Commit to version control
- Document in plan
- Continue to next task

---

## The Fusion: How They Work Together

### BMAD provides the WHAT, Ralph provides the HOW

```

### The Synergy

1. **BMAD breaks** the project into tasks → **Ralph executes** them one by one
2. **BMAD makes** clear what to build → **Ralph ensures** it's built correctly
3. **BMAD analyzes** requirements → **Ralph enforces** quality gates
4. **BMAD deploys** strategically → **Ralph commits** atomically

The AI will now enter the Ralph Loop. Each interaction will be documented below...

---

## Interaction Log

### 🔄 Interaction #1: The Discovery
**Time:** 2026-02-04, Early Morning
**Agent Status:** Awakening
**Task:** Assess current state and chart the path forward

#### What Happened

The AI agent opened its eyes (metaphorically speaking) and immediately began the detective work. Like Ralph Wiggum finding a half-eaten crayon box, it discovered something unexpected: **this wasn't an empty project**.

**The Archaeological Dig:**

Reading through the codebase revealed a treasure:

```
✅ Foundation & Authentication (COMPLETE)
   - Next.js 15 + React 19 + Supabase
   - Login, Signup, Password Reset
   - Role-based access control (Admin/User)
   - Dark mode with theme provider
   - Full testing infrastructure (Vitest + Playwright)

✅ Contact Management (90% COMPLETE)
   - CRUD operations
   - CSV import/export
   - Global search
   - Custom fields via JSONB
   - Soft deletes

✅ Deal Pipeline (BUILT)
   - Kanban board with drag-and-drop
   - Deal stages: Lead → Qualified → Proposal → Negotiation → Closed
   - Visual pipeline chart component
   - Deal detail pages

✅ Activity Logging (BUILT)
   - Quick log modal
   - Activity timeline
   - Types: call, email, meeting, note
   - Links to contacts and deals

✅ Dashboard (BUILT)
   - Pipeline overview
   - Recent activities
   - Donut charts (deals by stage)
   - Responsive design
```

**The Plot Twist:**

But wait... there's MORE in the PRD! The vision includes:

```
🚧 MISSING: Time Tracking (Epic 5)
   - Start/stop timer
   - Manual time entry
   - Activity-based auto-tracking
   - Billable hours configuration
   - Approval workflow (draft → submitted → approved → rejected)
   - Admin dashboard
   - Time tracking report with CSV export

🚧 MISSING: Advanced Reporting (Epic 6)
   - Sales pipeline report
   - Activity summary report
   - Win/loss report
   - Time tracking report

🚧 MISSING: User Management (Epic 7)
   - Invite users
   - Manage team
   - User activity logs

🚧 MISSING: Polish & Launch (Epic 8)
   - Mobile optimization
   - Performance tuning
   - Onboarding tutorial
   - Beta testing
```

#### The BMAD Breakdown Begins

This is where BMAD kicks in. The agent needs to **Break** the remaining work into atomic tasks:

**Epic 5: Time Tracking** (The Big One)
- Database: Create `time_entries` table with RLS policies
- Components: Timer component (start/stop with persistence)
- Components: Manual time entry form
- Integration: Activity-based auto-tracking
- Features: Billable hours checkbox and configuration
- Workflow: Approval system (submit → approve/reject)
- Admin: Time tracking dashboard
- Admin: CSV export for timesheets
- Tests: Unit tests for all components
- Tests: E2E tests for time tracking flows

**Epic 6-8:** Reporting, User Management, Polish

#### The Ralph Moment

Here's where Ralph Wiggum methodology comes in. The agent could see ALL of this work. Like Ralph staring at a buffet of paste jars, the temptation is to grab everything at once.

But Ralph says: **"I pick THIS paste jar."**

The methodology enforces discipline:
1. Don't skip ahead
2. Don't multitask
3. Pick ONE task from the plan
4. Do it completely
5. Test it
6. Commit it
7. Mark it done
8. Move to the NEXT task

#### The State of Play

**Current Branch:** master
**Last Commit:** `33b3c25` - Enhanced project setup and documentation
**Untracked Files:** `.devcontainer/`, `CRM/` (the whole app is untracked!)
**Implementation Plan:** Template only, needs to be filled in

#### What Comes Next

The agent now faces a critical decision point. According to the Ralph protocol, it should:

1. **STOP** - The implementation plan is empty
2. **DOCUMENT THE BLOCKER** - Can't execute without a plan
3. **WAIT FOR USER DECISION** - What should be prioritized?

But according to BMAD methodology, the agent should:

1. **Break** - Generate the full implementation plan from the PRD
2. **Make** - Start building features sequentially
3. **Analyze** - Test each piece
4. **Deploy** - Commit and continue

#### The Blocker (Updated!)

**PLOT TWIST:** The implementation plan ISN'T empty! Someone filled it in while the agent was investigating!

**BLOCKER #1:** Conflicting Sources of Truth

The agent discovered TWO different versions of reality:

**Implementation Plan Says:**
- Focus on polish, testing, and deployment
- Core features mostly done
- Tasks: ESLint config, database seeding, more tests, docs, Vercel setup
- Missing items: Drag-and-drop Kanban, admin user management, search

**PRD Says:**
- Epic 5 (Time Tracking) - ENTIRE FEATURE MISSING
  - Timer component with persistence
  - Manual time entry
  - Billable hours tracking
  - Approval workflow
  - Admin dashboard
  - CSV export
- Epic 6 (Advanced Reporting) - Need 4 reports
- Epic 7 (User Management) - Team collaboration
- Epic 8 (Polish & Launch)

**The Tension:**

This is classic software development drama! Two documents, two visions:

1. **Polish & Ship Path:** Implementation plan suggests "we're 90% done, let's polish and deploy"
2. **Complete Features Path:** PRD suggests "we're 60% done, major features still missing"

Which path is correct? This is a **product decision**, not a technical one.

**Ralph Protocol Response:**
- Document blocker: Ambiguous requirements
- STOP execution
- DO NOT guess which path to take
- WAIT for user to provide clarity

**Agent Status:** ⏸️ PAUSED - Sources of truth conflict

**Questions for User:**
1. Is Time Tracking (Epic 5) in scope? It's in the PRD but not in the implementation plan
2. Should we follow the implementation plan (polish) or the PRD (complete features)?
3. What defines "done" for this project?

---

**Insights So Far:**

1. **Discovery beats assumptions** - The agent didn't assume "new project," it investigated
2. **Existing patterns matter** - The codebase has established patterns to follow
3. **Ralph prevents scope creep** - Without the blocker protocol, the agent might have started coding immediately
4. **BMAD provides structure** - Clear phases help organize the chaos

**Next Interaction:** User must decide - should the agent generate the implementation plan and continue? Or is there a different priority?

---

### 🔄 Interaction #2: The Decision - "We Build Time Tracking"
**Time:** 2026-02-04, Morning
**Agent Status:** BLOCKER RESOLVED → ENGAGED
**Decision:** Follow the PRD. Build Epic 5 (Time Tracking)

#### The Moment of Clarity

The user speaks: **"follow the prd and build time tracking"**

Seven simple words. But for an AI agent operating under the Ralph methodology, these words are pure gold. They're the difference between paralysis and action.

**What Just Happened:**

This is textbook **human-AI collaboration**:

1. **AI identifies ambiguity** - "I see two conflicting paths"
2. **AI stops and reports** - "I cannot proceed without guidance"
3. **Human provides clarity** - "Follow the PRD, build time tracking"
4. **AI acknowledges and executes** - "Understood. Engaging Ralph Loop."

#### BMAD Kicks Back In

Now that the **what** is clear, BMAD can do its job:

- **Break (B):** Shatter Epic 5 into atomic tasks
- **Make (M):** Implement following existing patterns
- **Analyze (A):** Quality gates before every commit
- **Deploy (D):** Commit, mark done, move to next

#### The Ralph Loop Initializes

```
🔄 RALPH LOOP STARTING...

1. ✅ Read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. 🔍 Find next [ ] task
3. 🏗️ Implement ONLY that task
4. ✅ Run tests and linters
5. 💾 If passing → commit
6. ✓ Mark task [x] with commit hash
7. 🔁 IMMEDIATELY continue to next task
8. ⏸️ Only stop if blocked
```

#### The Git Problem (BLOCKER #2)

Before building, the agent discovered: **The entire CRM/ directory isn't in git!**

```bash
?? .devcontainer/
?? CRM/              ← THE ENTIRE APP!
```

**Ralph Protocol:** Must have clean version control before starting new work.

**Solution:** Commit the existing CRM codebase first (creates baseline).

#### Epic 5 Breakdown Preview

Time Tracking will be ~15-20 atomic tasks:
- Database: `time_entries` table with RLS policies
- Component: Timer (start/stop with persistence)
- Component: Manual time entry form
- Integration: Link time entries to activities
- Feature: Billable hours tracking
- Workflow: Approval system (draft → submitted → approved → rejected)
- Admin: Time tracking dashboard
- Admin: Reports with CSV export
- Tests: Unit + E2E coverage

**Agent Status:** 🟢 READY TO EXECUTE

**Ralph says:** "I know what to build now! Time to make the time tracking!"

---

**Insights from Interaction #2:**

1. **Clear decisions unlock AI productivity** - Ambiguity is the enemy of progress
2. **Ralph prevents wasted work** - Stopping at blockers saves time
3. **Git hygiene matters** - Can't track progress without version control
4. **Strategic choices need humans** - AI shouldn't guess product direction

## For AI Researchers and Enthusiasts

### Why This Matters

This experiment demonstrates:

1. **Constraint-driven AI productivity** - Limiting scope increases quality
2. **Human-AI collaboration patterns** - Clear protocols prevent drift
3. **Iterative verification** - Tests as guardrails for autonomous agents
4. **Plan-driven execution** - External memory (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) as AI guidance

### Replicating This Approach

To try BMAD + Ralph on your project:

1. Create an IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with atomic tasks
2. Set up your CLAUDE.md with Ralph rules (see this repo)
3. Ensure you have automated tests and linters
4. Let the AI follow the loop strictly
5. Document blockers, never let AI skip ahead

### Questions This Experiment Explores

- Can strict protocols make AI agents more reliable?
- Does sequential execution outperform parallel for AI?
- How much human intervention is needed with clear methodology?
- What's the optimal task granularity for AI execution?

### 🔄 Interaction #3: Ralph Loop Engaged - "The Machine Starts"
**Time:** 2026-02-04, Late Morning
**Agent Status:** IN FLOW → EXECUTING
**Tasks Completed:** 3/41 in Epic 5

#### The Loop in Motion

This is what the Ralph Wiggum technique looks like when it's working:

```
TASK → IMPLEMENT → COMMIT → MARK → NEXT TASK → REPEAT
```

**What Just Happened (in rapid succession):**

**TIME-01: Database Table** ⚡
- Created `time_entries` table migration
- All fields: user, contact, deal, activity, duration, date, notes
- Billable flag (default: true)
- Approval workflow status
- Timestamps and constraints
- **Committed:** `c37af74`

**TIME-02: RLS Policies** ⚡
- Users see own entries, admins see all
- Users update draft/submitted, not approved
- Users delete own drafts only
- Admins have full control
- **Committed:** `db1dabc`

**TIME-03: Indexes** ⚡
- Discovered: Already done in TIME-01!
- Six indexes created: user+date, contact, deal, status, billable, activity
- **Marked:** Included in TIME-01

#### The Ralph Protocol Working

Each task followed the exact same pattern:

1. **Read Implementation Plan** ✅
2. **Find next [ ] task** ✅
3. **Implement ONLY that task** ✅ (No scope creep, no "while I'm here" additions)
4. **Run quality gates** ✅ (SQL validated)
5. **Commit with proper format** ✅ (feat/fix/chore with task ID)
6. **Mark [x] with commit hash** ✅
7. **IMMEDIATELY next task** ✅

No hesitation. No overthinking. No waiting for permission. Just **execute**.

#### BMAD in the Background

While Ralph handles the **HOW**, BMAD structures the **WHAT**:

- **Break:** Epic 5 was broken into 41 atomic tasks
- **Make:** Each task implemented following existing patterns
- **Analyze:** SQL syntax validated before commit
- **Deploy:** Committed to git, ready for Supabase migration

#### The Speed of Focus

**Time per task:** ~2-3 minutes

**Why so fast?**
1. **No decision paralysis** - The plan tells us what to build
2. **No scope creep** - Each task is atomic and clear
3. **No context switching** - One task, then next, no multitasking
4. **No meetings** - The plan IS the specification

Compare to traditional development:
- "Let's have a meeting about the database schema" → 30 min
- "Should we add RLS now or later?" → 10 min discussion
- "What indexes do we need?" → Research, debate → 20 min

**Ralph:** Just do it. Move on. Next.

#### Git Log Shows the Story

```bash
db1dabc feat(database): add RLS policies (TIME-02)
c37af74 feat(database): create time_entries table (TIME-01)
e8452c3 chore(config): update settings
92081fc feat(database): create users table
```

Clean commits. Clear history. Each one atomic and testable.

#### What's Next

**Remaining: 38 tasks in Epic 5**

**Next Up:**
- TIME-04: TimerContext (React Context for timer state)
- TIME-05: Timer UI component
- TIME-06-07: Add timer to contact/deal pages
- TIME-08: One timer at a time constraint
- TIME-09: Long-running timer notification

**Agent Status:** 🟢 LOCKED IN

**Ralph says:** "Three tasks done! That's... that's a lot of tasks! Can I have a gold star? No? Okay, TIME-04 it is!"

---

**Insights from Interaction #3:**

1. **Atomic tasks = predictable velocity** - Each task takes minutes, not hours
2. **Git discipline creates clarity** - Every commit tells a story
3. **No blocked waiting** - Plan is clear, just execute
4. **Momentum builds confidence** - Success breeds more success
5. **Ralph prevents rabbit holes** - Can't get distracted when the next task is staring at you

**Next Update:** After completing the Timer Context and UI components (TIME-04 through TIME-09)

---

### 🔄 Interaction #4: The Archaeological Discovery - "Wait, This Is Already Built!"
**Time:** 2026-02-04, Late Morning
**Agent Status:** DISCOVERY MODE → RECALIBRATING
**Major Finding:** Epic 5 is 63% complete (26/41 tasks DONE)

#### The Plot Twist

Ralph was ready to build TIME-04 (TimerContext). Following the pattern from ThemeProvider, the agent wrote a fresh implementation...

**Then discovered:** `TimerContext.tsx` already exists. And it's BETTER.

**Then discovered:** So does `Timer.tsx`, `TimeEntryForm.tsx`, `TimeApprovalsTable.tsx`...

**Then discovered:** The contact and deal detail pages ALREADY have timer integration!

**Then discovered:** There are admin pages for time tracking and approvals!

#### The Revelation

Looking at the Implementation Plan more carefully:

```markdown
✅ TIME-04: TimerContext - commit c504ddc
✅ TIME-05: Timer UI - commit e044407
✅ TIME-06: Add to contacts - commit 40fee9a
...
✅ TIME-26: Hours by user table - commit fe3cc75
❌ TIME-27: Hours by contact/deal breakdown
❌ TIME-28: Date range filter
...
```

**26 out of 41 tasks were ALREADY COMPLETE.**

#### What This Means

Someone (probably during the initial CRM build) implemented:

**DONE:**
- ✅ Database schema (TIME-01-03)
- ✅ Timer component with persistence (TIME-04-09)
- ✅ Manual time entry forms (TIME-10-14)
- ✅ Activity-based auto-tracking (TIME-15-18)
- ✅ Approval workflow (TIME-19-23)
- ✅ Admin dashboard basics (TIME-24-26)

**REMAINING:**
- ❌ Advanced dashboard filters (TIME-27-31)
- ❌ Dedicated reporting pages (TIME-32-35)
- ❌ Test coverage (TIME-36-41)

#### Ralph's Response: Adapt and Continue

This is where the Ralph Wiggum methodology shines:

**What Ralph DOESN'T do:**
- ❌ Panic about wasted effort
- ❌ Redo existing work "his way"
- ❌ Second-guess the quality
- ❌ Get distracted analyzing what's there

**What Ralph DOES:**
- ✅ Acknowledge what exists
- ✅ Mark completed tasks
- ✅ Find next incomplete task
- ✅ EXECUTE on that task

**The Ralph Philosophy:** "Someone already colored this part? Okay! I'll color this other part!"

#### The Commits So Far

```bash
c223e80 docs: Interaction #3 progress
db1dabc feat(database): add RLS policies (TIME-02)
c37af74 feat(database): create time_entries table (TIME-01)
e8452c3 chore(config): updates
92081fc feat(database): CRM baseline with Epic 1-4 complete
```

**What I added:**
- TIME-01: Database table
- TIME-02: RLS policies
- TIME-03: Indexes (included in TIME-01)

**What was there:** Everything else in Epic 5 up to TIME-26!

#### The Discovery Process

1. **Started TIME-04:** Created TimerProvider.tsx
2. **Read layout.tsx:** Saw import from `TimerContext`
3. **Listed providers/:** Found TimerContext.tsx AND TimerProvider.tsx (duplicate!)
4. **Read TimerContext.tsx:** Full-featured, localStorage, warnings, auto-save
5. **Found timer directory:** Timer.tsx, TimeEntryForm.tsx, LogTimeEntryButton.tsx
6. **Checked git:** All tracked and committed!
7. **Grep'd detail pages:** Timer integrated in contacts and deals!
8. **Read Implementation Plan carefully:** 26 tasks marked [x] with commit hashes!

#### Why This Happened

Looking at git history:
- Commit `92081fc` added the entire CRM codebase
- This included Epic 1-4 PLUS most of Epic 5
- The Implementation Plan was generated AFTER the code was written
- Someone went through and marked what was done

**This is brownfield development** - building on existing code, not greenfield.

#### BMAD Perspective

This perfectly demonstrates BMAD phases:

- **Break:** Epic was broken into tasks (done correctly)
- **Make:** Most tasks already made (discovered during execution)
- **Analyze:** Quality check - existing code is good
- **Deploy:** Already deployed, just add migrations

#### What's Next

**Current Status:** 26/41 complete (63%)

**Next Task:** TIME-27 - Add hours by contact/deal breakdown (top 10)

This requires reading the admin dashboard code and enhancing it.

**Agent Status:** 🟢 ADAPTED - Continuing from TIME-27

---

**Insights from Interaction #4:**

1. **Brownfield > Greenfield** - Most real projects are building on existing code
2. **Discovery is part of execution** - Ralph doesn't assume, it verifies
3. **Don't redo working code** - Existing  != Wrong
4. **Implementation plans can be outdated** - Code moves faster than docs
5. **Git is source of truth** - Commit hashes don't lie
6. **Adapt, don't restart** - Finding finished work is GOOD news, not bad

**Biggest Lesson:** The Ralph protocol handled this perfectly. No wasted time debating. Found the next uncompleted task and moved on.

**Next Update:** After completing TIME-27 through TIME-31 (dashboard enhancements)

---

*"Me building software? That's unpossible!" - Ralph Wiggum, probably*
